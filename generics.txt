Generics: We can create flexible and reusable code components by Generics. Generics allow us to write functions, interfaces, types and classes that work with a varity of data types rather than a single, specific type.

Advantages of Using Generics:

# Flexibility: Generics allow us to build more flexible and adaptable components. Functions, classes or interfaces become more versatile rather than be a specific data type.

# Reusability: One of the primary advantages of generics is the ability to write code that can be reused with different data types. Single function or class that works with various types, eliminating the need to duplicate code.

# Type Safety: Generics maintain type safety while offering flexibility. When we use generics, TypeScript infers and enforces the correct data types, preventing type-related errors at compile time.

#  Dynamic Data Handling: Generics are particularly useful when working with dynamic data that can have different types. For example, collections, data structures, and utility functions can be made generic to handle various data types.

# Reduced Code Duplication: Generics reduced code duplicationand codebase are maintainale. We might have to write multiple version of the same function, each tailored to a specific data type.

Sample Code:

// Without generics, you'd need separate functions for different types:
function reverseArrayString(arr: string[]): string[] {
  return arr.slice().reverse();
}

function reverseArrayNumber(arr: number[]): number[] {
  return arr.slice().reverse();
}

// With generics, you can create a single, reusable function:
function reverseArray<T>(arr: T[]): T[] {
  return arr.slice().reverse();
}
